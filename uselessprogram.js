"The simplest kind of statement is an expression \
 with a semicolon after it. \
 It is a useless program, though. \
 A statement stands on its own, so it amounts to something \
 only if it affects the world. \
 The statements in the previous example \
 just produce the values 1 and true \
 and then immediately throw them away. \
 This leaves no impression on the world at all. \
 When you run this program, nothing observable happens.";
